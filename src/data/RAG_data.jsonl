It encourages individual independence and empowerment while also providing significant development advantages. Nonetheless, millions of children and adults continue to be denied educational chances, often because of poverty. In 2009, the Right to Education Act (RTE) guaranteed free and compulsory education for children and established it as a fundamental right under Article 21-A. It explains the importance of free and compulsory education for children aged 6-14 years in India under Article 21 (A) of the Indian Constitution. The Right to Education is a cornerstone for ensuring that every child has the opportunity to receive a high-quality elementary education."}
{"id":"right_to_education_india_article_21a_history","title":"Right to Education in India (Article 21A) - History and Background","content":"Article 21A was included to make the right to education a Fundamental right for children aged 6 to 14. Originally, Article 45 of the Indian Constitution and Article 39 (f) of the DPSP provided for state-funded, equal, and accessible education. The Ramamurti Committee Report, published in 1990, was the first formal document addressing the right to education. This clause recognises only primary education as a Fundamental Right, not further or professional education. The 86th amendment paved the way for the Right to Education Bill 2008 to be followed by the Right to Education Act 2009. The term \"free\" in the article means no child (except those allowed by their parents to a non-government school) is responsible to pay any fee, charge, or expense that may prohibit pursuing and completing primary education. This Act makes it mandatory for the government to ensure that all children aged six to fourteen years are admitted, attend school, and complete their elementary education. Essentially, this Act ensures that all children from economically disadvantaged families receive free elementary education. In the landmark case of Unnikrishnan JP against the State of Andhra Pradesh & Others, the Supreme Court ruled that education is a fundamental right derived from Article 21. The Tapas Majumdar Committee was established in 1999, with the goal of inserting Article 21A. In 2002, the 86th amendment to India's constitution designated education as a basic right in Part III of the Constitution. Article 21A states that the State shall offer free and compulsory education to all children aged six to fourteen years in the manner determined by the State."}

According to this, the right to education was declared a basic right and was withdrawn from the list of State Policy Directive Principles. The RTE is the follow-up law envisioned by the 86th Amendment. The term \"free\" appears in the title of the article, implying that no child (save those allowed by his or her parents to a school not financed by the government) is required to pay any form of fee, tax, or expenditure that may prohibit him or her from pursuing and finishing primary education.

The act aims to increase access to higher education, especially professional education, for students from socially and educationally deprived sections of society, as well as those from Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.

{"id":"right_to_education_act_2009_section_6","title":"Right to Education Act, 2009 - Section 6. Access to Elementary Education","content":"The rationale of this provision is to provide all children access to elementary education. Universal access requires schooling facilities within reasonable reach of all children. If schools are not located in or near the habitations where children reside, children may not complete schooling, even if they are formally enrolled in schools, on account of distance factors. The RTE Act therefore mandates the appropriate governments and local authorities to provide for children’s access to elementary schools within the defined area or limits of neighbourhood. The RTE Act deliberately does not define the limits or area of neighbourhood as a centralised norm, but requires the appropriate Government to notify such limits or area in the RTE Rules. This is on account of the very diverse geographical, climatic terrain and the varied development requirements of the different States, and the conscious decision that States would be better placed to define the ‘neighbourhood’, keeping the best interests of different children in mind. However, the Central Government has attempted to exemplify this in the Model RTE Rules circulated to States, which provide for distance norms of one kilometre for children in classes I-V, and three kilometres for children in classes VI-VIII, as also provision for relaxation of norms in places with difficult terrain where there may be risk of landslides, floods, lack of roads and in general, danger for young children in the approach from their homes to the school. The Model Rules also provide that access of children to school should not be hindered on account of social and cultural factors. Such norms should be laid down keeping in view local contexts and requirements, rather than centrally prescribed through a law. These have also been incorporated in the Central RTE Rules applicable to all UTs without Legislature. States /UTs need to arrive at a clear picture of current availability of schools within defined area or limits of neighbourhoods. In order to do this, State/UTs need to (i) define the neighbourhood norms keeping in view that all primary and upper primary schools and composite schools (with primary and upper primary sections), established by the State Government and local bodies would be neighbourhood schools for the purpose of section 3(1), and (ii) map the neighbourhoods or habitations and link them to specific schools. It is possible that a neighbourhood may be linked to more than one school. Similarly, a school may be linked to more than one neighbourhood. The mapping exercise will help identify gaps and areas where new schools need to be opened to ensure universal access."}
{"id":"right_to_education_act_2009_section_7","title":"Right to Education Act, 2009 - Section 7. Financial and Other Responsibilities","content":"Section 7(1) – (5) provides for financial and other responsibilities of the Central Government and the State Governments for carrying out the provisions of the proposed Act. The Central Government has estimated a total requirement of Rs 2.31 lakh crore over a five year period from 2010-11 to 2014-15 to implement the RTE Act. Separately, the 13th Finance Commission has also provided a grant of Rs 24,068 crore specifically for elementary education. The grant of the 13th Finance Commission is released directly on an annual basis to the State Governments from the Finance Ministry. This amount is deducted from the overall estimate of Rs 2.31 lakh crore, and the balance amount of Rs 2.07 lakh crore will be shared between the Central and State Governments in the 65:35 ratio for the implementation of RTE through the SSA programme. In the case of States in the North East Region, the fund sharing pattern will be in the 90:10 ratio. Section 7(6) provides for the formulation of a National Curriculum Framework. The Central Government has notified the NCERT as the designated authority for this purpose. The National Curriculum Framework, 2005, formulated by the NCERT has been hailed nationally and internationally as trendsetting in defining learning processes, assessment, quality and integration of various aspects of education geared towards producing a creative citizen of the country, and has been accepted as the Curriculum Framework under the RTE Act."}

Duties of Appropriate Government","content":"Section 8 assigns duties to the appropriate Government to ensure that it provides free and compulsory elementary education to every child, in a neighbourhood school. The term ‘compulsory education’ is explained to mean obligation of the appropriate Government to provide free elementary education and ensure compulsory admission, attendance and completion of elementary education. It further provides that where a child is not admitted to a school which is established, owned, controlled or substantially funded by the appropriate Government or local authority, such child or his or her parents will not be entitled to claim reimbursement of the cost of elementary education. It lays down the duties of the appropriate Government to ensure inter alia that children belonging to weaker sections and disadvantaged groups are not discriminated against and prevented from pursuing and completing elementary education, that admission, attendance and completion of elementary education by every child is monitored, that school building, teaching staff and learning equipment are provided, good quality elementary education conforming to norms and standards is provided, curriculum and courses of study are prescribed in a timely manner, and teachers are trained."}

{"id":"right_to_education_act_2009_section_10","title":"Right to Education Act, 2009 - Section 10. Responsibility of Parents or Guardians","content":"This provision casts a moral responsibility on every parent/guardian to admit their children/wards to school, and ensure that children are not deprived of their right to elementary education. This includes children involved in child labour, living in ecologically deprived areas, very poor slum communities, uprooted urban habitations, children of scavengers and stigmatised professions, children of itinerant or seasonal labour with mobile lifestyles like construction workers, road workers, and landless agricultural labourers required to augment family incomes. This provision should be read with the responsibility of the appropriate Government and local authority to provide free and compulsory elementary education in a neighbourhood school. It is not intended to compel parents/guardians and children/wards who do not wish to avail free education to necessarily admit their children in neighbourhood schools. Suggestions to penalize parents/guardians who do not send children to school were rejected, as most non-attending children are from weaker sections and disadvantaged groups, and penalizing parents would be penalizing poverty and deprivation. Many first generation learners lack home learning environments and drop out due to curriculum difficulties; penalizing parents would be discriminatory. Instead, the Act imposes a duty on the appropriate government to ensure admission, attendance, and completion of elementary education, leading to systemic reforms. Collaboration with civil society is encouraged to persuade parents, especially for older girls, to regularly send children to school."}

{"id":"right_to_education_act_2009_section_12","title":"Right to Education Act, 2009 - Section 12. Responsibility of Schools for Providing Free and Compulsory Education","content":"Section 12 explains the responsibility of schools for providing free and compulsory education to children, namely: (a) All Government schools shall provide free and compulsory education to all children; (b) Government aided institutions shall provide free and compulsory education to such percentage of students in elementary classes which equals the percentage of recurring aid received by it from the Government to the annual recurring expenditure incurred by the school, subject to a minimum of 25%; (c) Private unaided institutions and special category schools shall provide free and compulsory education to at least 25% children belonging to disadvantaged groups and weaker sections admitted to class I or pre-primary classes. Such schools would be entitled to reimbursement at the per-child cost incurred by the Government. It has also since been clarified that residential private unaided schools, which do not start at class I, would not be required to admit 25% children from disadvantaged groups and weaker sections in their schools. The Act’s Statement of Objects and Reasons emphasizes that inclusive elementary education is the responsibility of all schools, including those not dependent on Government funds, to promote equality, social justice, and democracy. Inclusive schooling encourages children from different backgrounds and abilities to study together, fostering social cohesion and alignment with constitutional values. The provision for 25% admission of children from disadvantaged groups and weaker sections in class I aims to create a critical mass to avoid segregation and promote meaningful classroom interaction. This percentage is based on demographic data, reflecting reasonable representation of these groups. Admission applies to class I only, with new cohorts admitted annually, allowing gradual social integration and adaptation of schools and teachers to diverse student populations. The policy particularly benefits younger children, whose social identities are still forming, supporting diversity and learning while opposing segregation. The broader objectives include promoting social cohesion and enriching learning by interaction among children from diverse socio-economic backgrounds, requiring appropriate classroom practices and teacher training to ensure recognition and equality for all students."}
{"id":"right_to_education_act_2009_section_13","title":"Right to Education Act, 2009 - Section 13. Prohibition of Capitation Fee and Screening Procedures","content":"Section 13 provides that no school or person shall collect capitation fee or subject a child to any screening procedure, and prescribes a penalty for contravention of these provisions. The Government, after consultation with several private school principals, issued guidelines under section 35(1) to ensure that admission procedures are non-discriminatory, rational, and transparent. Schools are prohibited from subjecting children and their parents to admission tests or interviews to decide whether to admit a child. Extensive educational research recognizes that all children are born with equal potential to learn, regardless of caste, class, gender, or IQ. Language acquisition by children at around two years is an intrinsic stage of brain development unaffected by social factors. Differences in learning revealed by tests reflect differences in nurturing rather than intrinsic ability. Therefore, the State and society have an obligation to provide better nurturing through good schools to children from poor and disadvantaged sections. The guidelines under section 35(1) state that tests and interviews serve mainly as tools for profiling and eliminating children and that screening to assess intelligence should be prohibited. Equal opportunity for children from diverse social and economic backgrounds reinforces constitutional equality and prevents discrimination. The guidelines promote composite classrooms with children from diverse backgrounds, which fosters inter-learning, respect for differences, tolerance, and creativity. For the 25% quota for disadvantaged and weaker sections admitted in class I, selection must be random from applications received. For the remaining 75%, schools have freedom to formulate their admission policies based on rational, reasonable, and just criteria aligned with the school's objectives. There shall be no profiling based on parental education qualifications. Admission policies must be publicly available in the school prospectus with wide publicity. No testing or interviews are allowed; selection must be random."}
{"id":"right_to_education_act_2009_section_14","title":"Right to Education Act, 2009 - Section 14. Proof of Age Certificate for Admission","content":"Section 14 seeks to provide for proof of age certificate of a child and that admission cannot be denied in its absence. The rationale for this provision is that birth certificates under the Births, Deaths and Marriages Certification Act, 1886 are often not available, and in their absence, children and their parents often have to run from pillar to post to obtain age proof. Thus, other documents can be deemed to be proof of age of the child for the purposes of admission in schools. Examples of other documents are (i) ANM register record, (ii) Anganwadi record, (iii) declaration of age of the child by the parent or guardian. State Governments will identify documents, which may be in the form of affidavits or certificates that can be used for determining the age of the child for admission and suitably provide for them in the delegated legislation. Clause 14(2) explicitly states that since the child has a right to education, that right cannot be denied for lack of age proof. Therefore, admission would be given even in the absence of age proof, while an appropriate document of age proof would simultaneously be acquired."}
{"id":"right_to_education_act_2009_section_15","title":"Right to Education Act, 2009 - Section 15. Prohibition of Denial of Admission","content":"Section 15 prohibits schools from denying admission to a child, irrespective of the time in the academic year in which admission is sought. Admission of a child in school is a fundamental right and cannot be denied at any point of time. Ideally, all children should be enrolled at the beginning of the academic session. However, children in difficult circumstances, including those affected by migration, displacement, or ill health, may require flexibility for admission at any time during the session. The Central RTE Rules provide that children admitted after six months from the beginning of the academic session may be provided Special Training as determined by the Head Teacher to help them complete studies. Private unaided schools need not be concerned with this provision for the 75% admission quota, as they usually fill all seats at the start of the academic year, making any-time admission unlikely."}
{"id":"right_to_education_act_2009_section_16","title":"Right to Education Act, 2009 - Section 16. Prohibition of Holding Back and Expulsion","content":"Section 16 prohibits holding back and expulsion of a child from school until completion of elementary education. The 'no detention' provision addresses the problem of examinations being used to eliminate children who score poorly, leading to repetition of grades or school dropout. Repeating a class is demotivating and does not offer additional support to the child. The provision does not abandon assessment but mandates continuous and comprehensive evaluation that is non-threatening and supportive, enabling teachers to focus on individual learning. Research shows failure to improve learning quality, and detention often causes children to abandon schooling. Regarding expulsion, despite concerns about deviant behavior, expulsion is incompatible with the child's right to education. No civilized country expels elementary children (ages 6-14). Instead, the education system must address behavioral issues through counseling and tailored curricular or co-curricular activities to help the child develop self-awareness and change behavior patterns."}
{"id":"right_to_education_act_2009_section_17","title":"Right to Education Act, 2009 - Section 17. Prohibition of Physical Punishment and Mental Harassment","content":"Section 17 prohibits any child from being subjected to physical punishment or mental harassment. The mistaken notion that discipline requires punishment and fear is refuted by educationists who emphasize a nurturing learning environment rather than a correctional one. Physical punishment and mental trauma are counter-productive and may increase defiance. Childhood, characterized by impressionability and vulnerability, demands protection and nurturance; even minor punishment can cause injury or lasting harm. Article 39(f) of the Constitution of India mandates that children develop with dignity, which cannot coexist with punishment. The National Policy on Education (1986/1992) also forbids corporal punishment. As a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child (UNCRC), India aligns with Article 19 that requires protection of children from all forms of violence and abuse. Thus, the RTE Act's ban on corporal punishment and mental harassment aligns with constitutional, national, and international obligations."}

{"id": "constitution_of_india_article_14", "title": "Constitution of India - Article 14 (Equality Before Law)", "content": "The State shall not deny to any person equality before the law or the equal protection of the laws within the territory of India. Article 14 consists of two parts: (1) equality before law — a negative concept prohibiting special privileges and discrimination, and (2) equal protection of laws — a positive obligation requiring the State to treat differently situated persons differently to achieve substantive equality. Equals should be treated equally; unequals unequally. This Article applies to both citizens and non-citizens. Judicial interpretation has established that Article 14 guarantees fairness, reasonableness, and non-arbitrariness in State action. It forms the foundation for the scheme of equality under the Constitution, and Articles 15 and 16 are specific applications of its principle."}
{"id": "constitution_of_india_article_15", "title": "Constitution of India - Article 15 (Prohibition of Discrimination)", "content": "(1) The State shall not discriminate against any citizen on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them. (2) No citizen shall, on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, place of birth or any of them, be subject to any disability, liability, restriction, or condition with regard to: (a) access to shops, public restaurants, hotels and public entertainment places; or (b) use of wells, tanks, bathing ghats, roads and places of public resort maintained wholly or partly out of State funds or dedicated to the use of the general public. (3) Nothing in this Article prevents the State from making special provisions for women and children. (4) Nothing in this Article or in Article 29(2) prevents the State from making special provisions for the advancement of socially and educationally backward classes of citizens, or for the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes. (5) Nothing in this Article or in Article 19(1)(g) prevents the State from making any special provision, by law, for the advancement of socially and educationally backward classes or for the Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes in relation to admission to educational institutions, including private institutions (aided or unaided), other than minority institutions under Article 30(1).\n\nJudicial commentary: Article 15 is a specific application of Article 14 (Dasaratha v. State of A.P., AIR 1961 SC 564). Equality means treating equals equally and unequals unequally, enabling positive discrimination for SCs and STs. In E.V. Chinnaiah v. State of A.P. (2005) 1 SCC 394, it was held that legislation designed to give effect to Articles 15 and 16 is not violative of Article 14 if the differentiation is reasonable. In Preeti Srivastava v. State of M.P. (1999) 7 SCC 120, Article 15(3) was described as protective discrimination for women and children, and Article 15(4) extended similar benefits to SC/STs and backward classes. Special provisions must be reasonable, advance equality, and cannot undermine other public interests."}
{"id": "constitution_of_india_article_16", "title": "Constitution of India - Article 16 (Equality of Opportunity in Public Employment)", "content": "(1) There shall be equality of opportunity for all citizens in matters relating to employment or appointment to any office under the State. (2) No citizen shall, on grounds only of religion, race, caste, sex, descent, place of birth, residence or any of them, be ineligible for or discriminated against in State employment. (3) Parliament may prescribe residence requirements for certain classes of employment within a State or Union territory. (4) The State may reserve appointments/posts for any backward class of citizens not adequately represented in State services. (4A) The State may reserve posts in matters of promotion, with consequential seniority, for SCs and STs not adequately represented. (4B) The State may treat unfilled reserved vacancies of a year as a separate class, to be carried forward, exempt from the 50% ceiling on reservations. (5) This Article does not affect laws requiring that holders of offices in religious or denominational institutions belong to that religion or denomination.\n\nJudicial commentary: Article 16, like Article 15, is an application of Article 14's equality principle. In the Thomas case (State of Kerala v. N.M. Thomas), the Supreme Court held that equality of opportunity includes compensatory measures to place SCs/STs on par with others, and that reservation could be permissible even under Article 16(1) to achieve real equality in results. Efficiency in administration (Article 335) remains a constitutional consideration. Affirmative measures, including reservations in promotions, are valid tools to achieve substantive equality in employment."}
{"id": "constitution_of_india_article_17", "title": "Constitution of India - Article 17 (Abolition of Untouchability)", "content": "Untouchability is abolished and its practice in any form is forbidden. Enforcement of any disability arising from untouchability is an offence punishable in accordance with law. The Untouchability Offences Act, 1955, renamed the Protection of Civil Rights Act in 1976, prescribes penalties for acts such as preventing a person from entering a place of worship or from accessing public water sources. Article 17 is self-executing and, read with Article 39(a)(ii), makes clear that untouchability is permanently outlawed. Though addressed mainly to private conduct, it also binds the State."}

(2) No citizen of India shall accept any title from any foreign State. (3) No non-citizen holding any office of profit or trust under the State shall accept any title from a foreign State without the President's consent. (4) No person holding any office of profit or trust under the State shall, without the President's consent, accept any present, emolument, or office of any kind from or under any foreign State. This provision prevents the creation or perpetuation of titles that could undermine equality and democratic republican values."}
{"id": "constitution_of_india_article_19_to_22", "title": "Articles 19-22: Right to Freedom - Overview and Golden Triangle Doctrine", "content": "Article 19(1) of the Constitution guarantees to all citizens certain freedoms: (a) freedom of speech and expression; (b) to assemble peaceably and without arms; (c) to form associations or unions; (d) to move freely throughout the territory of India; (e) to reside and settle in any part of the territory of India; (f) omitted; (g) to practise any profession or to carry on any occupation, trade or business. Articles 19(2) to 19(6) impose reasonable restrictions on these freedoms in the interests of sovereignty, integrity, security, public order, decency, morality, or other specified grounds. The inter-relationship between Articles 14, 19, and 21 was examined in Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (1978) 1 SCC 248, holding that Article 21 does not exclude Article 19; laws depriving personal liberty must meet the tests of Articles 14 and 19. In Minerva Mills v. Union of India (1980) 3 SCC 625, the Court described Articles 14, 19, and 21 as the 'Golden Triangle.' Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab (1982) 3 SCC 24 reaffirmed their vital role in the rule of law. T.R. Kothandaraman v. TN Water Supply Board (1994) 6 SCC 282 described the trinity as paving the path to liberty, equality and fraternity. The right to information, though not originally explicit, has been recognised under Article 19(1)(a) in cases like State of U.P. v. Raj Narain (1975) 4 SCC 428 and S.P. Gupta v. Union of India (1981 Supp SCC 87), emphasising open government."}
{"id": "constitution_of_india_article_20_to_21", "title": "Article 20 - Protection in Respect of Conviction for Offences", "content": "Article 20 contains three safeguards: (1) No person shall be convicted except for a violation of a law in force at the time of the act, nor subjected to a penalty greater than what was applicable at that time (protection against ex post facto laws). (2) No person shall be prosecuted and punished for the same offence more than once (double jeopardy). (3) No person accused of any offence shall be compelled to be a witness against himself (protection against self-incrimination). In Kalpnath Rai v. State (1997) 8 SCC 732, the Court applied Article 20(1) to offences under the amended TADA Act. Maqbool Hussain v. State of Bombay, AIR 1953 SC 325, discussed Art. 20(2). Article 20(3) has been described as 'humane' and consistent with the requirement of just and fair trials under Article 21."}
{"id": "constitution_of_india_article_21", "title": "Article 21 - Protection of Life and Personal Liberty", "content": "Article 21 states: 'No person shall be deprived of his life or personal liberty except according to procedure established by law.' Initially interpreted narrowly in A.K. Gopalan v. State of Madras, AIR 1950 SC 27, where the freedoms under Articles 19, 21, 22, and 31 were seen as exclusive. This view was overturned in R.C. Cooper v. Union of India (1970) where the Court held that detention law must satisfy both Articles 21 and 19. In Kharak Singh v. State of UP, AIR 1963 SC 1295, 'personal liberty' was expansively defined. Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (1978) held that any deprivation of liberty must meet the triple test: (i) valid law; (ii) conformity with applicable Article 19 freedoms; and (iii) compliance with Article 14. The law must be just, fair, reasonable—not arbitrary. Judicial interpretation has expanded Article 21 to include rights such as legal counsel, protection from bonded labour, livelihood, immediate medical aid, free legal aid, and education (Article 21A). The Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, implements Article 21A."}
{"id": "constitution_of_india_article_22", "title": "Article 22 - Protection in Cases of Arrest and Detention", "content": "Article 22(1) and (2) grant arrested individuals the rights to be informed of grounds of arrest, consult a legal practitioner, and be produced before a magistrate within 24 hours; no further detention is permitted without magistrate approval. Articles 22(3)–(7) address preventive detention: allowing it under stringent safeguards, with maximum detention without Advisory Board opinion limited to three months. Parliament may prescribe circumstances and maximum periods of such detention. In Pankaj Kumar Chakrabarty v. State of W.B. (1969), preventive detention was seen as a 'necessary evil' subject to safeguards. In Alka Subhash Gadia (1992), the Court stressed that action under Article 22 must meet the constitutional tests of Articles 14, 19, and 21. Preventive and punitive detention are both permitted if authorised by valid law and procedure."}
{"id": "constitution_of_india_article_23", "title": "Article 23 - Prohibition of Traffic in Human Beings and Forced Labour", "content": "Article 23(1) prohibits traffic in human beings, begar (forced unpaid labour), and all similar forms of forced labour. Any contravention is an offence punishable by law. Article 23(2) allows the State to impose compulsory service for public purposes, but without discrimination based on religion, race, caste, or class. This right applies against both the State and private individuals. It covers human trafficking for immoral purposes, bonded labour, and any compulsion depriving a person of free choice to work. In People's Union for Democratic Rights v. Union of India (1982), the Supreme Court explained that this Article was included to provide immediate enforceable protection against exploitation, given the socio-economic conditions post-independence. The object was to eradicate bonded and forced labour, which were relics of feudal society and incompatible with an egalitarian order. In Gaurav Jain v. Union of India (1997), the Court noted that Article 23 also protects the rights of vulnerable women and children. Violation can be prosecuted under laws such as the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act."}
{"id": "constitution_of_india_article_24", "title": "Article 24 - Prohibition of Employment of Children in Factories, etc.", "content": "Article 24 prohibits the employment of children below 14 years of age in any factory, mine, or other hazardous employment. This is a fundamental right enforceable against the State and private employers. The Supreme Court in M.C. Mehta v. State of Tamil Nadu (1996) took note of widespread child labour in hazardous industries and directed measures for abolition, including compulsory education, health check-ups, nutritional support, and responsibility sharing between industries and State governments. In Bandhua Mukti Morcha v. Union of India (1997), the Court ordered policy formulation for eradicating child labour and ensuring welfare of affected children. Article 24 is complemented by Article 21-A, introduced by the 86th Constitutional Amendment, which mandates free and compulsory education for children aged 6–14 years, and by the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009."}
{"id": "constitution_of_india_article_25", "title": "Article 25 - Freedom of Conscience and Free Profession, Practice and Propagation of Religion", "content": "Article 25(1) guarantees all persons freedom of conscience and the right to freely profess, practise, and propagate religion, subject to public order, morality, health, and other provisions of Part III. Article 25(2) permits the State to regulate or restrict any secular activity associated with religious practice, and to enact laws for social welfare and reform, including throwing open Hindu religious institutions of a public character to all classes and sections of Hindus. Explanation I specifies that wearing and carrying kirpans is part of the Sikh religion. Explanation II clarifies that references to Hindus include Sikhs, Jains, and Buddhists. Supreme Court rulings such as M. Ismail Faruqui v. Union of India (1994) affirm secularism as part of equality and the constitutional scheme; Commissioner of Police v. Acharya Jagadishwarananda Avadhuta (2004) links religious freedom with Article 14’s anti-discrimination principles. In Sri Venkataramana Devaru v. State of Mysore (1958), the Court applied the rule of harmonious construction, holding that denominational rights under Article 26(b) are subject to laws under Article 25(2)(b)."}
{"id": "constitution_of_india_article_26", "title": "Article 26 - Freedom to Manage Religious Affairs", "content": "Subject to public order, morality, and health, every religious denomination or any section thereof has the right to establish and maintain institutions for religious and charitable purposes, manage its own affairs in matters of religion, own and acquire property, and administer such property according to law. The Supreme Court has applied these rights in contexts where denominational autonomy may intersect with State reforms, emphasising that in case of overlap, harmonious interpretation with Article 25(2)(b) ensures both community management and social reform objectives."}
{"id": "constitution_of_india_article_27", "title": "Article 27 - Freedom from Taxation for Promotion of a Religion", "content": "No person shall be compelled to pay taxes, the proceeds of which are specifically appropriated for the promotion or maintenance of any particular religion or religious denomination. This provision upholds secularism by ensuring that State-collected taxes are not used to favour or finance religious activities of any specific faith."}
{"id": "constitution_of_india_article_28", "title": "Article 28 - Freedom as to Attendance at Religious Instruction or Religious Worship in Certain Educational Institutions", "content": "Article 28(1) prohibits religious instruction in educational institutions wholly maintained by State funds. Article 28(2) provides that this does not apply to institutions administered by the State but established under endowment or trust requiring religious instruction. Article 28(3) ensures that no person attending any State-recognised or State-aided institution shall be required to take part in religious instruction or worship without consent, or, in the case of minors, the guardian’s consent. This Article safeguards individual choice in religious participation within publicly supported educational contexts."}
{"id": "constitution_of_india_article_29", "title": "Article 29 - Protection of Interests of Minorities", "content": "Article 29(1) grants any section of the citizens residing in India or any part thereof, having a distinct language, script, or culture of its own, the right to conserve the same. Article 29(2) prohibits denial of admission into any educational institution maintained by the State or receiving State aid on grounds only of religion, race, caste, language, or any of them. This protection applies to all citizens, whether majority or minority, and is linked to preserving linguistic, cultural, and script-based diversity. In T.M.A. Pai Foundation v. State of Karnataka (2002), the Supreme Court clarified that Article 29(1) is not religion-specific; it covers any section with distinct language, script, or culture. State-aided or State-maintained institutions—irrespective of who established them—cannot deny admission on grounds prohibited by Article 29(2). Article 29 operates alongside Article 30, fortifying minority rights to conserve identity through education while ensuring non-discrimination in public educational admissions."}
{"id": "constitution_of_india_article_30", "title": "Article 30 - Right of Minorities to Establish and Administer Educational Institutions", "content": "Article 30(1) grants all minorities, whether based on religion or language, the right to establish and administer educational institutions of their choice. Article 30(1A) provides that in laws for compulsory acquisition of property of a minority institution, compensation must not restrict or abrogate the Article 30(1) right. Article 30(2) prohibits the State from discriminating in granting aid to educational institutions on the ground that they are managed by a minority. In Sidhajbhai Sabbai v. State of Gujarat (1963), the Court held Article 30(1) as an absolute right, subject only to reasonable regulations regarding efficiency, discipline, health, sanitation, morality, and public order. In State of Kerala v. Very Rev. Mother Provincial (1970), it was emphasised that minority institutions must maintain standards of excellence and follow the general education pattern while retaining management rights. Ahmedabad St. Xavier’s College Society v. State of Gujarat (1974) underscored equality between majority and minority institutions in the right to education. St. Stephen’s College v. University of Delhi (1992) addressed balancing Article 30(1) with Article 29(2), holding that minority management must coexist with State powers to regulate education standards. T.M.A. Pai Foundation (2002) held Articles 29 and 30 essential to secularism and equality, ensuring minority protection without reverse discrimination. P.A. Inamdar v. State of Maharashtra (2005) affirmed that the right to establish and administer is unfettered if no State aid or recognition is sought, but general laws on public safety, national integrity, and prevention of exploitation still apply."}
{"id": "constitution_of_india_article_32", "title": "Article 32 - Remedies for Enforcement of Rights Conferred by this Part", "content": "Article 32(1) guarantees the right to move the Supreme Court by appropriate proceedings for enforcement of the rights conferred by Part III (Fundamental Rights). Article 32(2) empowers the Supreme Court to issue directions, orders, or writs, including habeas corpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto, and certiorari, for enforcement of any of these rights. Clause (3) allows Parliament to empower other courts to exercise similar powers within their jurisdiction. Clause (4) states that the right under Article 32 shall not be suspended, except as provided by the Constitution, such as during a state of emergency under Article 359. Dr. B. R. Ambedkar called Article 32 the \"heart and soul\" of the Constitution, as it ensures guaranteed access to enforce fundamental rights. Alongside Article 32, Article 226 grants High Courts the power to issue writs for enforcing Fundamental Rights and for any other purpose, extending broader jurisdiction than Article 32, which is confined to Fundamental Rights enforcement."}

It also enables Parliament to validate sentences passed, punishments inflicted, forfeitures ordered, or other acts done under martial law in such an area. This provision ensures legal protection for actions taken during extraordinary situations involving martial law."}

Parliament must make such laws as soon as possible after commencement of the Constitution. Clause (b) continues pre-Constitution laws relating to these matters until altered, repealed, or amended by Parliament. The Explanation adopts the meaning of 'law in force' from Article 372. Article 35 centralises law-making in sensitive areas relating to Fundamental Rights to maintain uniformity across India."}
